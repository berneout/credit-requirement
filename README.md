# Software Credit Requirement

The Software Credit Requirement is a legal tool that software developers can use to require credit for their work.  Using the Software Credit Requirement, software developers can require the same kind of credit that contributors to other kinds of work---motion pictures, music, video games, books, and so on---already receive.  They can also help to establish a norm of appropriate credit in the software industry.

The Software Credit Requirement works by adding an additional requirement to the license applied to the software.  Common open source software licenses---MIT, BSD, Apache, Blue Oak, GPL, and so on---do not effectively require credit.  But applying, say, the MIT License _plus_ the Credit Requirement gives others all the rights they usually receive under the MIT License, so long as they give credit.
