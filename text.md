# Software Credit Requirement

Development Draft

## Purpose

These terms ensure that this software project, and contributors to it, receive due public credit for their contributions to goods and services produced with their work, to build project credibility and contributor reputations.

## Credit

As an additional condition to the public license for this software, you must give this software project, and each each contributor to it, credit for other goods and services that you produce and provide using this software.

## How to Credit

In general, you must give credit in such a way that the audience for your good or service, and the public at large, can freely and readily find a written notice identifying each contributor, by name, as a contributor to this software, and this software, by name, as a contribution to your good or service.

## Conventions

Where widespread convention dictates a particular way to give credit for your kind of good or service, follow that convention.  For distributed software, give credit in documentation and notice files.  For software provided as a web service, give credits in `credits.txt`, according to <https://creditstxt.com>.

## Who to Credit

If this software provides project and contributor names in a conventional way, you may rely on that information for accuracy and completeness in giving credit.  For example, if this software includes project and contributor name information in standardized software package metadata, as output from a `credits` subcommand or `--credits` flag, in an `About` screen accessible from this software's menu system, or on a credits page linked from the bottom of pages served by this software, you may rely on the accuracy and completeness of that information.  If this software does not provide project and contributor names, and no link to source code repository where it can be found, you need not perform independent research to find contributor names to credit.
